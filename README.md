# BTM_HarmonyLogger
Tool for modders to easily set up a logging logic during mod development.

The aim is to easily be able to check if the patched methods are called in-game and to be able to establish the workflow of a specific classes combination.

As for now the logger will log every active methods in HarmonyLogger/HarmonyLogger.log and a duplicate in HarmonyLogger/<ClassName>.log
